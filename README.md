# CertSync multipage static site

This site was generated from your Figma page exports. It uses Tailwind via CDN (no build step).

## Pages
- `index.html` (Home)
- `about.html`
- `pricing.html`
- `policy.html`
- `contact.html`

## Brand colour
A primary brand colour was auto-detected from **Home page.png** and mapped into a small `tailwind.config` object inline. Edit that object to set exact colours (or share your hex values and I'll lock them in).

## Deploy (GitHub Pages)
1. Create a repo (e.g. `certsync-site`), commit all files (root).
2. Settings → Pages → Deploy from a branch → `main` / `/ (root)`.
3. Open: `https://<username>.github.io/<repo>/`

## Assets
Original Figma exports were copied to `/assets`. A smaller hero image `home-hero.webp` was generated for the homepage.
